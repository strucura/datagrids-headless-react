# Headless DataGrids

> [!WARNING]
> This package is under active development and is not yet ready for production use.

At this point in time, I do not have a desire to release a full-fledged DataGrid component. Instead, I want to provide a set of tools that can be used to build DataGrids in a headless manner. This means that you can use the tools provided by this package to build your own DataGrid components, without being tied to a specific implementation.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @strucura/datagrids-headless-react
```
